AWS CERTIFICATION PREP
======================

Project Status
--------------		
- Start: 		Jun 4, 2018
- Last Update:	Jun 11, 2018


Introduction
------------
I started playing with AWS EC2 in 2012. Initially, it was so I could demo basic pubic cloud concepts to co-workers. Afterwards, I used EC2 as a dev environment for some Python projects I was working on. During this time, I developed a good handle on the basics of EC2, but never really dug in deep. Later, I moved to using Digital Ocean. Mostly, because of cost differences (at the time) and the simple REST API.

Recently, I decided to come back to using AWS and pursue certification (for career reasons).

I have created this public GitHub project to force me to be more organized with my notes/code-samples. I am approaching this project as if, I am developing a training resource for others. I know this approach will help be more thorough and systematic in my certification journey, but I sincerely hope others will find value in it.

I expect this project to be a work in progress for at least 12 months.

Approach
--------
As I have started to reacquaint myself with AWS, I have spent a lot of time working with the console, but I prefer to work with the API. All the exercises in this project will use the API, unless impossible. I will leave it up to the individual familiarize themselves with the console.
