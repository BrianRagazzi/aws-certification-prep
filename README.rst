AWS CERTIFICATION PREP
======================

Project Status
--------------		
- Start: 		Jun 4, 2018
- Last Update:	Jun 12, 2018


Introduction
------------
Recently, I decided to pursue AWS certification (for career reasons). I been playing with AWS EC2 off and on since 2012, but have never used it in any meaningful way. Considering how much the AWS ecosystem has grown over the years, I have my work cut out for me. In addition to certification, I want to improve my knowledge of AWS APIs, so I plan to get as much hands-on experience as possible via Python/Boto3.

I have created this public GitHub project to force myself to be more organized with my notes and code. I am going to approach this project, as if I am developing a training resource for others. I know this approach will help me on my certification journey, but I sincerely hope others will find value in it.

I expect this project to be a work in progress for at least 12 months.

Certifications
--------------
I have decided to pursue the following certifications.

-  AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate
-  AWS Certified Advanced Networking – Specialty
-  AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional

Exam Guides

-  `AWS Certified Advanced Networking – Specialty <https://d1.awsstatic.com/training-and-certification/docs-advnetworking-spec/AWS%20Certified%20Advanced%20Networking_Speciality_Exam_Guide_v1.1_FINAL.pdf>`_

-  `AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional <https://d0.awsstatic.com/Train%20&%20Cert/docs/AWS_certified_solutions_architect_professional_blueprint.pdf>`_

AWS Services (in-scope for this project)
----------------------------------------
- Compute
	EC2, ECS, Lamba
- Storage
	S3, EFS, Glacier
- Database
	RDS, DynamoDB
- Networking & Content Delivery
	VPC
- Management Tools
	CloudWatch, AWS Auto Scaling, CloudFormation, CloudTrail
- Security, Identity & Compliance
	IAM, Certificate Manager

*Note: It is likely these will change as I develop my knowledge/skills.*

Approach
--------
As I develop my knowledge and prepare for the exams listed above, I expect to go through the following phases.

	- Understand the basics of each service 
	- Get comfortable configuring and using each service
	- Build a deeper understanding of each service
	- Understand how each service fits into an overall architecture
	- Be able to discuss/explain all the above with others

As I have started to reacquaint myself with AWS, I have worked with the console, but I ultimately I prefer to work with the API. All the exercises in this project will use the API, wherever possible. I will leave it up to the individual familiarize themselves with the console.

*Note: Following the exercises in this project will generate costs to your AWS account. These should be relatively small, especially if you are new to AWS (increased eligibility for free-tier). An explanation of the expected costs will be provided at the beginning of each exercise.*
