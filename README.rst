AWS CERTIFICATION PREP
======================

Project Status
--------------		
- Start: 		Jun 4, 2018
- Last Update:	Jun 11, 2018


Introduction
------------
I started playing with AWS EC2 in 2012. Initially, it so I could demo the basic concepts of public cloud to co-workers, then I started using it to create VMs for dev work. I had learned the basics of EC2, but never dug in very deeply. Later, I changed to using Digital Ocean for creating my VMs. Mostly, because of cost differences (at the time) and the simple REST API. 

Recently, I decided to come back to using AWS and pursue certification (for career reasons).

I have created this public GitHub project to force me to be more organized with my notes/code samples. I am approaching it like I am developing a set of tutorials. I know this approach will help be more thorough and systematic in my personal development, but I sincerely hope others will find value in it.

I expect this project to be a work in progress for at least 12 months.
